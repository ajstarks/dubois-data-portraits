# Du Bois Visualizations for Consideration in STEM Education

(Note that the plate numbers referenced below are from [W. E. B. Du Bois's Data Portraits: Visualizing Black America](https://papress.com/products/w-e-b-du-boiss-data-portraits-visualizing-black-america)

## Figure 1: Time series graph

![plate40](original-plate-40.jpg)

One of the rare line charts in the collection, the comparative population growth of white and Black Americans from 1790-1890, is annotated with relevant events like "Suppression of Slave Trade", Immigration" and  "Emancipation".

## Figure 2: Time Series Percent Area Graph

![plate51](original-plate-51.jpg)

With the green waters of Freedom plunging down a waterfall set on the dark base of slavery, "Proportion of Freeman and Slaves Among American Negroes" shows number of enslaved and free from 1790 to 1870.

## Figure 3: Percentage Bar Graph of Dichotomous Variable Status (literacy) By Select Categories (National / Racial Community)

![plate47](original-plate-47.jpg)

Comparing the state of Black Americans with the larger world, "Illiteracy of American Negroes compared with that of other nations" shows Black American's illiteracy in red, in the middle of a sea of green, higher than countries like France, but better than others like Russia.

## Figure 4: Categorical Map of Population Location With Population Size Legend

![plate02](original-plate-02.jpg)

A choropleth outlining the population of Black Americans, by state. Note the concentration in the South, with Georgia leading (750,000 or more).

## Figure 5: Fan Chart for Categorical Percentage Distributions in Two Comparison Groups

![plate01](original-plate-27.jpg)

The fan chart compares Black and white population's occupations, using color and area to faciliate comparisons.


## Figure 6: Cartographical Visualization of Population Location and Movement

![plate01](original-plate-01.jpg)

"The Georgia Negro, A Social Study" shows the transatlantic slave trade, with routes from Europe, Africa, the Americas and the Caribbean, highlighting Georgia. This visual contains Du Bois' famous assertion: "The problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line"


## Figure 7: Multivariate stacked bar graph by continuous covariate brackets, with photographic and other data element details

![plate31](original-plate-31.jpg)

The horizontal stacked bar charts show how various economic groups
spend their income among these categories: Rent, Food, Clothes, Taxes, and 
other expenses and giving. This visual is distinct in that it includes photographs along with the chart.

## Figure 8: Partial Table Bar Graph â€“ i.e. Bivariate Categorical Relationship (Marriage Status by Racial / National Group) Broken Out by Control Variable (Age)

![plate10](original-plate-10.jpg) 

The "Conjugal Condition" visual compares three groups (single, married, widowed and divorced), divided by age: (15-40, 40-80, and over 80) within two populations: Black Americans and the country of Germany.  The data is shown clearly using six proportional bar graphs in the red, yellow and green color scheme.

## Figure 9: Bar/Spiral chart
Uses color and contrasting lengths to highlight quantitative demographic differences.

## Figure 10: Bar Chart
"Acres of Land Owned by Negroes in Georgia" is a conventional bar chart with a twist. The chart shows the increase of land owned between 1874 (338,769 acres) and 1899 (1,023,741), with the red shape of the data echoing the map of Georgia.  

![plate19](original-plate-19.jpg)

## Figure 11: County-level Choropleth
Echoing the previous chart, this map shows land owned by the formally enslaved over three decades post-emancipation.

![plate20](original-plate-20.jpg)

## Figure 12: Spiral Chart
"Assessed Value of Household and Kitchen Furniture Owned by Georgia Negroes" uses the spiral form to emphasize the gains in material goods over a quarter century.
