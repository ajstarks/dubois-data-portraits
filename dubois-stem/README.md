(Note that the plate numbers referenced below are from [W. E. B. Du Bois's Data Portraits: Visualizing Black America](https://papress.com/products/w-e-b-du-boiss-data-portraits-visualizing-black-america)

![plate31](original-plate-31.jpg)

The horizontal stacked bar charts show how various economic groups
spend their income among these categories: Rent, Food, Clothes, Taxes, and 
other expenses and giving. This visual is distinct in that it includes photographs along with the chart.

## Visual03 (plate 03)

This chart compares city and rural populations. The city populations range from 2.5-5K, 5K-10K, and over 10K. in 1890, the majority of people resided rural country and village areas, shown here as a tightly wound red spiral in contrast to the angled, connected city populations.

## Visual04 (plate 38)

![plate38](original-plate-38.jpg)

This map shows the distribution of Black Americans. Heavy concentrations are in the South (largest in S. Carolina, Mississippi, Virginia). The mid-west and northeast is more sparely populated, with the west and extreme north showing < 1 person/sq. mile.

## Visual05 (plate 57)

![plate57](original-plate-57.jpg)

Using boldly colored blocks, this abstract visual shows the varied businesses run by Black men. Including mercantile, grocers (the largest, shown as a large gold block), building contractors, druggists, and bankers.  The total estimated capital of $8.7 million ($282.6 today).

## Visual06 (plate 60)

![plate60](original-plate-60.jpg)

The jauntily tilted stacked bar chart shows the categories of crime among the Black American population (property crime is the highest, gov't the lowest). The incident of prisoners is 3,250/million (compared to 1501/100,000 today).

## Visual07 (plate 27)

![plate27](original-plate-27.jpg)

"Occupations of Negroes and Whites in Georgia" is not quite an pie chart, but a "fan chart", comparing the occupations of two groups. The chart is a good example of the typical Du Bois color palette.

## Visual08 (plate 40)

![plate40](original-plate-40.jpg)

One of the rare line charts in the collection, the comparative population growth of white and Black Americans from 1790-1890, is annotated with relevant events like "Suppression of Slave Trade", Immigration" and  "Emancipation".

## Visual09 (plate 43)

![plate43](original-plate-43.jpg)

A trio of stacked bar charts in the vibrant Du Bois colors, shows the occupations that Black Americans were engaged in, by gender. (compare this to plate 27).

## Visual10 (plate 8)

![plate08](original-plate-08.jpg)

Prior to the "Great Migration" that would begin in 1910, this map shows the places Georgia-born Black people migrated to, along with the migration of them to other parts of the country.


## Visual11 (plate 2)

![plate02](original-plate-02.jpg)

A choropleth outlining the population of Black Americans, by state. Note the concentration in the South, with Georgia leading (750,000 or more).

## Visual12 (plate 5)

Another choropleth focusing on the Black population within the State of Georgia/

![plate05](original-plate-05.jpg)

## Visual13 (plate 7)

Continuing the theme of using Georgia as a exemplar, this line graph shows the comparative increase of the Black and White population in Georgia.  This chart is notable in that it reverses the modern convention, using time for the Y-axis and the data for the X

![plate07](original-plate-07.jpg)

## Visual14 (plate 10)

The "Conjugal Condition" visual compares three groups (single, married, widowed and divorced), divided by age: (15-40, 40-80, and over 80) within two populations: Black Americans and the country of Germany.  The data is shown clearly using six proportional bar graphs in the red, yellow and green color scheme.
