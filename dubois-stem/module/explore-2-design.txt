This visual makes uses a bold color
contrast (black for slavery, green for
freedom) to show the proportion of
enslaved and free people.
\n
The area is dominated by black, with
contrasting large text, yet the eye is
drawn to the sudden jolt of green
freedom in 1865. Note that increasing
data goes down instead of up.
\n
The titles are bilingual (a nod to the
venue), and the X-axis is labeled at the
top, contrary to todayâ€™s convention.
Instead of a labeled Y-axis, each
individual data point is labeled.
