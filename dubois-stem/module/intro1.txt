The Du Bois Stem module will consist of three sections: (1) Context, explaining the motivation of the Du Bois visuals in a historical context (2) Exploration: an analog exercise to analyze and re-create Du Bois visuals using hand-drawn methods (3) Implement: Re-create Du Bois style visuals using digital tools.

The sections are meant to be additive, used in the order stated above, but they may be used individually according to prior knowledge or background.
