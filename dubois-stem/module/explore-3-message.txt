The research question behind this 
visualization is tied to Du Bois’ larger 
research agenda and the audience at the 
Paris Exposition:
\n
What have Black 
Americans accomplished since 
emancipation that defied racist view of 
the time?
\n
Speaking to the expo’s global audience, 
this graph answers this question by 
comparing illiteracy of Black Americans 
(outlined in red) to that of other countries.
\n
The Black illiteracy rate is higher than 
countries like France, but better than 
others like Russia where serfdom still 
denied literacy to peasants.
