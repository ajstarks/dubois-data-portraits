The message of the visual is tied to the
overall message from Du Bois at the
Paris Exposition:
\n
Describe the status and progress of
Black Americans since emancipation,
and provide an alternative narrative to
racist views of the time.
\n
Comparing the state of Black Americans
with the larger world, the visual shows
Black Americans illiteracy in red, in the
middle of a sea of green, higher than
countries like France, but better than
others like Russia.
