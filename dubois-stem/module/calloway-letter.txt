“…thousands upon thousands will go [to the fair], and a 
well selected and prepared exhibit, representing the
Negro's development in his churches, his schools, his homes, 
his farms, his stores, his professions and pursuits in general 
will attract attention… and do a great and lasting good in
convincing thinking people of the possibilities of the Negro”
