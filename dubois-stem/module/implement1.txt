The Implement section builds on the Context and Explore sections and
guides you through building a Du Bois-style visualization using digital
tools.
\n
The example shown here uses R and Jupyter notebook, which provides an
interactive environment to explore the visual, starting from a basic
graph, to applying the Du Bois style.

Note that participants of the Du Bois Challenge, an annual online
exercise that re-creates a curated set of Du Bois visuals, provides
examples of digital re-creations using tools such as R,
python/matplotlib, and Tableau.
