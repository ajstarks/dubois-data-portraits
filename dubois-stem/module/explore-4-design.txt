This visual has three sections: title,
choropleth map, and legend, uses a
combination of color (black, brown, tan,
red, pink, gold) and cross-hatching to
encode ten categories of population
data.
\n
The solid and cross-hatched black is
used to represent the higher
populations based in the South, red and
pink encode the mid-level populations,
gold used for lower populations. A
neutral color is used to states with a
very small Black population.
\n
Note the use of ample white space to
allow the eye to focus on the map.
