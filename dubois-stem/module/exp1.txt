This section is a hands-on session that will take a sample Du Bois
visualization, (Plate 27 in this example) and reconstructs and
analyzes various aspects of the visual.
\n
The exercise aims to recreate the sample visual using hand-drawn methods
(pens, paper, markers, etc.), to immerse the students in the act of
creation, while thinking about the context and messaging.  Rapid iteration
and peer review may be used to gauge effectiveness of the visual.  
\n
Next, drawing with modern data may be introduced.
