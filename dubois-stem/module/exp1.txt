This section is a hands-on session that takes sample Du Bois 
visualizations, and reconstructs and analyzes various aspects of 
the visual.
\n
In this exercise you will recreate sample visuals using 
hand-drawn methods similar to those used by Du Bois and his 
collaborators (pens, paper, markers, etc.), to immerse yourself 
in the act of creation, while thinking about the the research 
question and audiences Du Bois engaged. You will use rapid 
iteration and peer review to gauge effectiveness of the visual.
\n
In the final part of the exercise, you will draw your own 
visualization with modern data.
