This section is a hands-on session that takes sample Du Bois visualizations, and reconstructs and analyzes various aspects of the visual.
\n
In this exercise you will recreate sample visuals using hand-drawn methods similar to those used by Du Bois and his collaborators
(pens, paper, markers, etc.), to immerse yourself in the act of creation, while thinking about the the research question and audiences Du Bois engaged.
\n
Rapid iteration and peer review may be used to gauge the effectiveness of the visual.
In the final part of the exercise, you will draw your own visualization with modern data.
