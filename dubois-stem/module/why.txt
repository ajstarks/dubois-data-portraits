It is difficult for people analyze data involving many 
complex relationships and hundreds (or billions!) of data 
points.
\n
Visualizing data with graphs can help a scientist answer 
research questions involving such complex relationships 
and large amounts of data. 
\n
Graphs can also help scientists explain their research 
findings to other scientists and non-scientists.
