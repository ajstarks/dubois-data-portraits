The message of the visual is tied to the
overall message from Du Bois at the
Paris Exposition:
\n
Describe the status and progress of
Black Americans since emancipation,
and provide an alternative narrative to
racist views of the time.
\n
The visual compares free and slave
populations from 1790 to 1870, using an
area chart with two primary colors
representing freedom and slavery.
