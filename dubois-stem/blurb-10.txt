The "Conjugal Condition" visual compares three groups (single, married, widowed and divorced), divided by age: (15-40, 40-80, and over 80) within two populations: Black Americans and the country of Germany.  The data is shown clearly using six proportional bar graphs in the red, yellow and green color scheme.
